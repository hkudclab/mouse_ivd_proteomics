<b>ABSTRACT (246 words) </b><br>
Mouse models are commonly used to study the intervertebral disc (IVD) biology and disease states such as intervertebral disc degeneration, where a functional proteome is critical for disc homeostasis. Here, we provide a comprehensive proteomic profiling of healthy young adult murine discs (n=31). Leveraging on a dataset with over 2,700 proteins, we identified key molecular and cellular differences between disc compartments and spine levels, but not between genders. We revealed novel biology processes that can be studied in the mouse, in reference to the human IVD, and concluded that despite structural and cellular differences, much of the biology is conserved and relevant to human. In annulus fibrosus (AF), oxidative stress responses (Sod3 and Clu) were enriched; while in nucleus pulposus (NP), junction and cell-cell communication (Cdh2, Dsp and Gja1) and osmoregulation (Slc12a2 and Wnk1) proteins were noted for cell volume regulation. Mouse NP cells are enriched in lysosomal proteins with vacuoles that are heterogenous, with Lamp1/2 marking about half of the vacuoles and some containing lipid droplets and other large vacuoles with undefined contents. Two novel markers for NP (Cd109) and AF (Col12a1) were identified. Finally, in using the mouse as a model for IVD studies, it is noteworthy that key metabolic differences exist such as elevated mitochondrial proteins in the lumbar discs than the tail, and the non-additivity distribution of proteins between compartments and levels. Overall, much IVD biology can be studied using the mouse, taking advantage of the size, genetic and accessibility for manipulation.<br>
